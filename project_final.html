            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>
                This project seeks to contextualize and visualize the impact of the pandemic 
                on companies in the airline industry and the overall changes in consumer demand. 
                It seeks to do so by analyzing the number of flights and routes over each quarter, 
                which carriers are more common for a certain route, what fares passengers paid, 
                distances travelled for each route, and the overall number of passengers per quarter. 
                It is important to do so because it helps to efficiently communicate and depict complex 
                flight trends over a vast amount of time and how exogenous variables like changes in policies 
                and guidelines can impact the sector. Given that flights are a primary mode of transportation 
                connecting people across vast distances, it is fascinating to observe shifts in human behavior 
                and the domestic response to major disruptions like a pandemic. Additionally, visualizing the 
                recovery of these networks across regions and routes reveals how such events influence 
                macroeconomic trends and reshape domestic interactions.

            <h2>Our Dataset:</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/us-airline-flight-routes-and-fares-1993-2024/data ">US Airline Flight Routes and Fares 1993 – 2024</a></p>
            <p>
                The dataset we will use is the ‘US Airline Flight Routes and Fares 1993 – 2024.’  
                In this dataset, we primarily focused on analyzing the financial data, passenger data, and time data. 
                The overall column variables include a table identifier, year, quarter, origin city market 
                ID, destination city market ID, origin city, destination city, origin airport ID, 
                destination airport ID, origin airport code, destination airport code, distance 
                between airport, number of passengers, average fare, the largest carrier by passengers, 
                and market share of the largest carrier. This is a large dataset, having 23 columns 
                and containing 63.04 MB of data. The dataset we have chosen includes nearly 250,000 rows of data. When 
                dealing with a platform like GitHub, that is simply too much data to parse through. 
                Additionally, we were not concerned with gathering data from 1993-2024, rather we were 
                concerned with data that allowed us to view the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on Boston's airline industry. 
                We took less than 5% of this dataset to focus on the years 2018 to 2023, 
                parsing the data to include only rows that include those dates. Additionally, 
                since we were only looking at flights that departed from Boston, we removed 
                all rows that did not include a departure from the Boston metropolitan area. We 
                obtained this dataset from Kaggle. The only missing data is some of the geolocation 
                data, which wasn't as necessary in graphs because the city name data was included.

            <h2>Tasks:</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have summarized how we worked with the data, here are some of the steps we took to clean the data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Removed unnecessary columns from the dataset</li>
                    <li>Filtered the data for all years aside from 2018-2023, and deleted these rows</li>
                    <li>Filtered the data for all flights that did not depart from the Boston metropolitan area, and deleted those rows</li>
                    <li>Added an additional column for airline, which used a legend to relate the airline code to their full name</li>
                    <li>Parsed through the dataset, removing "(Metropolitan Area)" which was present after several major cities, so that the cities would populate on our visualizations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                With the data clean, here is what we were looking to do with the data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Visualize changes in customer demand over time for air travel through trends and variability in fares charged and number of flights</li>
                    <li>Evaluate which airlines have the most amount of passengers and any detectable behaviors in fares charged and market share</li>
                    <li>Create a map showing which destination cities are most popular to visit and evaluate and compare the passenger volume passengers traveling to each city</li>
                    <li>Observe any noticeable trends that COVID-19 might have played out on different variables such as miles traveled, fares charged, passengers on flights, and carrier volumes</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <p>This graph displays the airlines with the most flights in Boston. From the graph, the two airlines, represented as "WN" (Southwest Airlines) and "AA" (American Airlines), dominate the market with the highest number of flights, exceeding the other carriers. "WN" leads with approximately 1,600 flights, closely followed by "AA" with around 1,400 flights. Other carriers, such as "B6" (JetBlue Airways), "DL" (Delta Air Lines), and "UA" (United Airlines), have considerably fewer flights, with numbers ranging from about 400 to 800, indicating they have a notable but not much compared to "WN" or "AA". Several other carriers are also present, such as "AS" (Alaska Airlines), "MX", "NK" (Spirit Airlines), and others, but they contribute little to not to the overall flight volume, each having only a few hundred or fewer flights compared to the leading airlines. The graph illustrates a highly skewed distribution, with the majority of flights concentrated among a few dominant airlines, while the rest operate a small number of flights. This disparity reflects a competitive imbalance, suggesting that a handful of carriers hold a significant market share and likely benefit from higher consumer visibility and brand loyalty, while the smaller airlines might serve specialized routes or have limited operational capacity. The overall pattern highlights a clear disparity in airline operations in Boston, indicating a strong market presence for a few leading carriers while others maintain a minimal role.</p>

<!-- Conclusion Section -->
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted flights departing from Boston,
                 showing significant changes in passenger behavior and airline operations 
                 from 2018 to 2023. This project focused on trends in passenger volume, 
                 airfare, carrier dominance, and route popularity, offering insights into 
                 the sudden change and subsequent recovery in the airline industry. Prior
                  to the pandemic, flights to popular destinations like New York, Florida,
                   and California consistently had numerous passengers. However, 2020-2021,
                    there was a sharp decline in travel due to restrictions, with a slow 
                    recovery starting in 2022 as travel continued.</p>
            <p>Airfare trends reflected these sudden changes, with fares dropping during 
                the pandemic due to reduced demand and rising again in 2022-2023 as
                 the airline industry recovered as time went on. The study also 
                 highlighted how major carriers maintained their dominance in the industry,
                  while smaller airlines faced challenges. Long-distance routes recovered 
                  more steadily compared to mid-distance or shorter routes, indicating 
                  increased interest in long travel post-pandemic.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project illustrates the ups and downs of the airline industry 
                and provides a deeper understanding of how global events can reshape 
                transportation networks. The findings emphasize the importance of 
                flexibility and adaptation for airlines to navigate and avoid future 
                disruptions and please consumer demands and trends. In the future, we would 
                also like to look at flight cancellation and delay data so that we can build a 
                model that predicts the probability of delays for specific routes. Regarding flight carriers,
                we would like to look more at their financial data and what variables it potentially correlates to 
                flight route and fare data. </p>
